The Incubator Lesson Spotlight highlights a lesson under development by our community in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator]. In this edition, we look at the progress being made on [the _{{page.lesson_title}}_ lesson][lesson-pages], and hear from the authors about how The Carpentries community can get involved with the ongoing development of this lesson.

## Lesson Profile

* **Title:** {{page.lesson_title}}
* **Lesson Pages:** https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/metagenomics/
* **Lesson Repository:** https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/metagenomics

### Learning Objectives

* Acknowledge the importance of a well organized bioinformatics project and apply this sense of tidyness to the given data.
* Learn and implement the guidelines for a good reproducible metagenomic project.
* Understand and apply the basics for Unix and R programming languages.
* Use of Unix and R programming languages to assess and manipulate metagenomics data.
* Learn and use the steps and tools for a complete analysis of shotgun and 16S metagenomic data.

### Target Audience

Genomic and metagenomic enthusiasts; newcomers to the bioinformatic world; and biological science undergraduate, postgraduate students and researchers. We do not assume previous knowledge of bash, R or metagenomics for the lesson.

## Lesson Progress

Our lesson is in the alpha stage. All episodes are completely written in the sense that they are at minimum a viable product ready to provide the learners their teaching goal. Nevertheless, we still want to continuously improve them, we are discussing how to avoid some pre-calculated data, how to include a 16S section and if we should include other metagenomic tools for quality check. We have already taught it twice only by our team members. But we are looking forward to new opportunities to share it, instructor notes are ready.

We developed three sections thinking about a full metagenomic workshop. These sections are organization (https://nselem.github.io/organization-metagenomics/), shell-metagenomics (https://nselem.github.io/shell-metagenomics/) and metagenomics diversity analysis (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/metagenomics). The first two are adaptations of the genomic workshop to our metagenomics data; their goal is to introduce learners about what to think about before starting a metagenomic project and to basic linux terminal skills. The third section uses the terminal to explore the quality of our metagenomics data, but then transitions into an introduction to the R language to explore metagenomic indexes.

## How You Can Help Develop This Lesson

We want to take our lesson to beta status, so, we would love instructors from the Carpentries community to participate by running our lesson in their city and to contribute to its development. Also, we welcome feedback relating the contents and the ways of approaching issues relating to Unix and R programming.
